# Repository for lessons and projects about Spring Framework 6 and Spring Boot 3
First you have to install a version of Java compatible with Spring Framework 6 and Spring Boot 3, for the development of this project I used the version 17.0.2. 
I recommend using Visual Studio for the IDE, where you will need to install the following extensions:
-Extension Pack for Java
-Spring boot Extension Pack

Then you will be able to test the application developped in the project by opening a web server in the port specified in the file "aplication.properties"
